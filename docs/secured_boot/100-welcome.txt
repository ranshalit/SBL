About 3mdeb




Our mission is to enhance platform security using the expertise we gained in Root of Trust, Chain of Trust,
Trusted Computing, TPM, coreboot, UEFI/EDK II, Yocto, U-Boot, and Linux. Dasharo and Zarhus OS, are
products designed to enhance the trustworthiness of every computing device through open development
principles. We prioritize transparency, digital sovereignty, and the right to repair in creating resilient embedded
firmware solutions, ensuring secure systems for the community and our clients.
Goals of the Training
By the end of the 4-day remote training, participants will be able to:

   Describe the core components, architecture, and flow of the Slim Bootloader and Intel Root of Trust
   technologies, as presented in guided demonstrations.
   Recognize typical configuration steps and tooling workflows used to set up, debug, and verify Slim
   Bootloader-based platforms and Intel security primitives.
   Interpret the intent and expected outcomes of provisioning and integration processes shown during the
   training.
   Assess the applicability of these technologies in their own environments, based on observed use cases and
   best practices shared by the trainer.

 Reviewers and students who provided feedback.
Disclaimer
The following training session on the x86 boot process, Slim Bootloader, and Intel Root of Trust is designed to
provide participants with a foundational understanding of these complex topics. We recognize that these
subjects are intricate and that comprehensive coverage of all aspects would require significantly more time
than is available in this schedule.

As a result, this training involves simplifications and a focus on key concepts that are essential for practical
understanding. While we strive to deliver high-quality content, it’s important to note that certain nuances and
advanced details may be omitted. Our goal is to provide a streamlined learning experience that fits within the
allocated time frame while still delivering valuable insights.

We acknowledge that many participants may have years of experience in these fields, and we appreciate the
depth of knowledge they bring to the discussion. We encourage participants to provide feedback, as this will
help us improve the materials continuously and better address the needs of our audience.

Additionally, the trainer acknowledges that their knowledge, while extensive, is not exhaustive. Continuous
learning and engagement with industry developments are essential, and input from participants can
significantly enhance the overall training experience.

By participating in this training, you agree to understand and accept these limitations.

Engagement and Ground Rules #1
 4 days of lectures (4.5h hours per day, from 10:00 to 15:00 IST).
 30min break ~12:00.
 At the end of the course, there will be an evaluation survey.
 Please mute your mic, when you not speaking.
 Multitasking is enemy of every training.
 Questions should be saved until the end of each module to avoid redundancy.
 Please remain present and engaged during the training.
 Each module ends with quizzes.
 If you notice a potential bug, please let me know, or propose your fix through contribution.
 Feedback is always welcome.
Engagement and Ground Rules #2
 If we are running overtime or if the training is becoming boring, please let me know   🙂
 Please note that sometimes, even though we click, the slides do not change. I am simply getting through
 my notes; it is not a technical issue.
Odroid-H4+ Purchase
Please note you can buy Odroid-H4 with Dasharo (Slim Bootloader + UEFI) v0.9.0 to repeat all demos which
were presented during this course.
