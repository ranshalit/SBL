  Roots of Trust by
establishment time
S-RTM
 Static Root of Trust for Measurement - established at a fixed point in time typically, platform reset
      it can be implemented as code or as hardware
      is the mechanism mutable or immutable?
 S-RTM is as good as code/hardware making initial measurement
 Initial measurement protection (Silicon Vendor Security Technologies):
      Intel Boot Guard, AMD HVB/PSB, NXP HAB, Rockchip Secure Boot etc.
 Local attestation: coreboot+TrustedGRUB2, Dasharo+LUKS2, Microsoft BitLocker
 Problems
      requires a reboot to re-establish trust
      requires NDA with SV and skilled personnel to protect initial measurement
      most hardware vendors do not implement it correctly
      not standardized measurement information (event log)
      complexity: over 20 keys involved (~5 just for Intel Boot Guard)

Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement
 Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement - established at an arbitrary point in time through a dedicated mechanism (e.g.
 CPU instruction)
      it can be implemented as code or as hardware
 It was standardized according to the TCG D-RTM Architecture specification.
 Currently, most active development related to the implementation of D-RTM technology in FOSS is TrenchBoot.
      TrenchBoot goal is to upstream support for D-RTM for all FOSS relevant projects, starting with Linux kernel,
      GRUB2 bootloader, Xen, there is even some preliminary work on coreboot.
 Microsoft leverage D-RTM technology under System Guard.
 There are multiple hardware specific standards discussing and publications discussing D-RTM:
      Intel® Trusted Execution Technology (Intel® TXT)
      Intel Software Developers Manual - chapter 7
      AMD Architecture Programmer’s Manual - chapter 15.27
      DRTM Architecture for Arm

How that applies to our use case?
 We should always start analysis from CPU microarchitecture we trying to secure.
 Microarchitecture documentation should define platform on which it can be integrated, what defines
 security properties and potential mechanisms which can be used.
 Our target platform is Intel Alder Lake N, but following applies to all modern Intel-based platforms.
      Intel Boot Guard serves as Root of Trust for Verification (RTV) as well as Static Code Root of Trust for
      Measurement (S-CRTM).
      Intel Boot Guard is not related or dependent on firmware stack, but its properties may align better of
      worse with some implementations.
      Intel Boot Guard implementations differ slightly between microarchitectures (number eFuse slots,
      ability to transfer ownership, tooling).
      Intel Boot Guard is responsible for validation of Initial Boot Block (IBB), further chain of trust
      (transitive trust) continuation depends on firmware stack.

How to protect S-RTM?
 It depends on the mechanism delivered by the platform and/or silicon vendor.
 Verified Boot-like technologies with strong RoT (Intel Boot Guard, AMD Hardware Validated Boot, NXP
 High Assurance Boot, etc.)
 How hard is it to sign firmware and fuse/provision platform?
      it really depends on the vendor,
 What we can do with all those measurements in TPM?
      local attestation - secret unsealing,
      remote attestation,
 Maybe Measured Boot and S-RTM don’t make sense, and Verified Boot is the one to rely on?
      ownership transfer,
      vendor lock-in,
      closed, centralized authority vs open, decentralized community,

Conclusion
In this lecture, we learned about the following:

  What are the taxonomies of Root of Trust and Chain of Trust technologies.
  Where in those taxonomies Intel Alder Lake (e.g. Intel N97) and other modern Intel hardware is placed
  with its security properties.
  Basics of Measured Boot works and for what it can be used.

This information will provide us with a solid foundation for understanding:

  Root of Trust Assessment, Integration and Provisioning.
  Deep diver into Slim Bootloader implementation of Verified Boot and Measured Boot.
