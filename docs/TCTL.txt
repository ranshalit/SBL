1     Introduction
1.1   COM Express Concept
      COM Express is an open industry standard defined specifically for COMs (computer on modules). Its creation makes it possible to smoothly
      transition from legacy interfaces to the newest technologies available today. COM Express modules are available in following form factors:
                             •    Mini		          84 mm x 55 mm
                             •    Compact         95 mm x 95 mm
                             •    Basic		         125 mm x 95 mm
                             •    Extended        155 mm x 110 mm
      Table 1      COM Express 3.0 Pinout Types

       Types     Connector       PCIe Lanes   PEG SATA Ports    LAN ports               USB 2.0/       Display Interfaces
                 Rows                                                                   SuperSpeed USB
       Type 6    A-B C-D         Up to 24     1      Up to 4    1                       Up to 8 / 4 1    VGA,LVDS/eDP, PEG, 3x DDI
       Type 7    A-B C-D         Up to 32     -      Up to 2    5 (1x 1 Gb, 4x 10 Gb)   Up to 4 / 4
       Type 10   A-B             Up to 4      -      Up to 2    1                       Up to 8 / 2 1    LVDS/eDP, 1xDDI

      1.
           The SuperSpeed USB ports (USB 3.0) are not in addition to the USB 2.0 ports. Up to 4 of the USB 2.0 ports can support SuperSpeed USB.

      The conga-TC570 modules use the Type 6 pinout definition and comply with COM Express 3.0 specification. They are equipped with two high
      performance connectors that ensure stable data throughput.

      The COM integrates all the core components and is mounted onto an application specific carrier board. COM modules are legacy-free design
      (no Super I/O, PS/2 keyboard and mouse) and provide most of the functional requirements for any application. These functions include, but
      are not limited to a rich complement of contemporary high bandwidth serial interfaces such as PCI Express, Serial ATA, USB 2.0, and Gigabit
      Ethernet. The robust thermal and mechanical concept, combined with extended power-management capabilities, is perfectly suited for all
      applications.

      Carrier board designers can use as little or as many of the I/O interfaces as deemed necessary. The carrier board can therefore provide all the
      interface connectors required to attach the system to the application specific peripherals. This versatility allows the designer to create a dense
      and optimized package, which results in a more reliable product while simplifying system integration.

      Most importantly, COM Express modules are scalable, which means once an application has been created there is the ability to diversify the
      product range through the use of different performance class or form factor size modules. Simply unplug one module and replace it with
      another; no redesign is necessary.

      Note

      1. Do not use the CMOS battery power consumption values listed above to calculate CMOS battery lifetime.

      2. Measure the CMOS battery power consumption of your application in worst case conditions (for example, during high temperature and
         high battery voltage).

      3. Consider the self-discharge of the battery when calculating the lifetime of the CMOS battery. For more information, refer to application
         note AN9_RTC_Battery_Lifetime.pdf on congatec GmbH website at www.congatec.com/support/application-notes.

      4. We recommend to always have a CMOS battery present when operating the conga-TC570.

2.8     Storage Specifications
        This section describes the storage conditions that must be observed for optimal performance of congatec products.


2.8.1   Module
        For long-term storage of the conga-TC570 (more than six months), keep the conga-TC570 in a climate-controlled building at a constant
        temperature between 5°C and 40°C, with humidity of less than 65% and at an altitude of less than 3000 m. Also ensure the storage location is
        dry and well ventilated.

        Note

        We do not recommend storing the conga-TC570 for more than five years under these conditions.


2.8.2   Cooling Solution
        The heatpipes of congatec heatspreaders/cooling solutions are filled with water by default. For optimal cooling performance, do not store the
        heatspreaders/cooling solutions at temperatures below -20°C.

        Caution

        1. For temperatures between -10°C and -20°C, preheat the heatpipes before operation. Optionally, the heatpipes can be filled with acetone
           instead. For more information, contact your sales representative.

        2. For optimal thermal dissipation, do not store the congatec cooling solutions for more than six months.

    Note

    1. We recommend a maximum torque of 0.4 Nm for carrier board mounting screws and 0.5 Nm for module mounting screws.
    2. The gap pad material used on congatec heatspreaders may contain silicon oil that can seep out over time depending on the environmental
       conditions it is subjected to. For more information about this subject, contact your local congatec sales representative and request the gap
       pad material manufacturer’s specification.

    Caution

    1. The congatec heatspreaders/cooling solutions are tested only within the commercial temperature range of 0° to 60°C. Therefore, if your
       application that features a congatec heatspreader/cooling solution operates outside this temperature range, ensure the correct operating
       temperature of the module is maintained at all times. This may require additional cooling components for your final application’s thermal
       solution.
    2. For adequate heat dissipation, use the mounting holes on the cooling solution to attach it to the module. Apply thread-locking fluid on
       the screws if the cooling solution is used in a high shock and/or vibration environment. To prevent the standoff from stripping or cross-
       threading, use non-threaded carrier board standoffs to mount threaded cooling solutions.
    3. For applications that require vertically-mounted cooling solution, use only coolers that secure the thermal stacks with fixing post. Without

        Note

        1. The MAC address of the Intel i226 Ethernet controller is preprogrammed by default. The MAC address cannot be reprogrammed. If you
           require custom MAC address, contact your local sales representative.

        2. The GBE0_LINK# output is not active during a 10 Mb connection. It is only active during a 100 Mb or 1 Gb connection. This is a limitation
           of Ethernet Phy since it has only three LED outputs—ACT#, LINK100# and LINK1000#. The GBE0_LINK# signal is a logic AND of the
           GBE0_LINK100# and GBE0_LINK1000# signals on the conga-TC570 module.

        3. Only the conga-TC570 industrial variants support both Intel® TSN and TCC.

        4. Windows Operating System does not support TSN.

        5. Beginning with BIOS revision BxTLRx37, you can configure the Ethernet LEDs to operate in either COM Express 3.0 or 3.1 mode. To set
           the LEDs to COM Express 3.0 mode (default), go to Advanced -> Misc in the BIOS setup menu and enable the “COM Express Compliant
           Ethernet LED Configuration” option.

         To revert to the previous COM Express 3.1 configuration, disable this option. For more information about Ethernet LED specifications, see
         the COM Express documentation or contact congatec technical support.

5.1.13   Power Control
         Power OK (PWR_OK) from main power supply or carrier board voltage regulator circuitry. A high value indicates that the power is good and the
         module can start its onboard power sequencing.

         Carrier board hardware must drive this signal low until all power rails and clocks are stable. Releasing PWR_OK too early or not driving it low
         at all can cause numerous boot up problems. It is a good design practice to delay the PWR_OK signal a little (typically 100ms) after all carrier
         board power rails are up, to ensure a stable system.

         A sample screenshot is shown below:




         Note

         The module is kept in reset as long as the PWR_OK is driven by carrier board hardware.

         Copyright © 2021 congatec GmbH 							TCTLm108 							                                                                                     34/76
The conga-TC570 PWR_OK input circuitry is implemented as shown below:

                                                                                   +V12_S




                                       R1%47k5S01                                        R1%10kS01


                                                         R1%1k00S01
                                                                                                     To Module Power Logic
                             PWR_OK


                                       R1%20k0S01                                        R1%4k75S01
                                                                      TBC847




The voltage divider ensures that the input complies with 3.3 V CMOS characteristic and also makes it possible to use the module on carrier
board designs that do not drive the PWR_OK signal. Although the PWR_OK input is not mandatory for the onboard power-up sequencing, it
is strongly recommended that the carrier board hardware drives the signal low until it is safe to let the module boot-up.

When considering the above shown voltage divider circuitry and the transistor stage, the voltage measured at the PWR_OK input pin may be
only around 0.8 V when the 12 V is applied to the module. Actively driving PWR_OK high is compliant to the COM Express specification but this
can cause back driving. Therefore, congatec recommends driving the PWR_OK low to keep the module in reset and tri-state PWR_OK when
the carrier board hardware is ready to boot.

The three typical usage scenarios for a carrier board design are:
• Connect PWR_OK to the “power good” signal of an ATX type power supply.
• Connect PWR_OK to the last voltage regulator in the chain on the carrier board.
• Simply pull PWR_OK with a 1k resistor to the carrier board 3.3 V power rail.
With this solution, you must ensure that by the time the 3.3 V is up, all carrier board hardware is fully powered and all clocks are stable.

The conga-TC570 supports the controlling of ATX-style power supplies. If you do not use an ATX power supply, do not connect the conga-TC570
pins SUS_S3/PS_ON, 5V_SB, and PWRBTN#.


Copyright © 2021 congatec GmbH 							TCTLm108 							                                                                                         35/76
         SUS_S3#/PS_ON#

         The SUS_S3#/PS_ON# (pin A15 on the A–B connector) signal is an active-low output that can be used to turn on the main outputs of an
         ATX-style power supply. To accomplish this the signal must be inverted with an inverter/transistor that is supplied by standby voltage and is
         located on the carrier board.

         PWRBTN#

         When using ATX-style power supplies, PWRBTN# (pin B12 on the A–B connector) is used to connect to a momentary‑contact, active-low
         debounced push-button input while the other terminal on the push-button must be connected to ground. This signal is internally pulled up to
         3V_SB using a 100 kΩ resistor. When PWRBTN# is asserted it indicates that an operator wants to turn the power on or off. The response to this
         signal from the system may vary as a result of modifications made in BIOS settings or by system software.


Power Supply Implementation Guidelines
         The 12 V input power is the sole operational power source for the conga-TC570. Other required voltages are generated internally on the
         module using onboard voltage regulators.

         Note

         When designing a power supply for a conga-TC570 application, be aware that the system may malfunction when a 12 V power supply that
         produces non-monotonic voltage is used to power the system up. Though this problem is rare, it has been observed in some mobile power
         supply applications.

         This problem occurs because some internal circuits on the module (e.g. clock-generator chips) generate their own reset signals when the
         supply voltage exceeds a certain voltage threshold. A voltage dip after passing this threshold may lead to these circuits becoming confused,
         thereby resulting in a malfunction.

         To ensure this problem does not occur, observe the power supply rise waveform through an oscilloscope during the power supply qualification
         phase. This will help to determine if the rise is indeed monotonic and does not have any dips. For more information, see the “Power Supply
         Design Guide for Desktop Platform Form Factors” document at www.intel.com.

5.1.14   Power Management
         ACPI

         The conga-TC570 supports Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification, revision 4.0a. It also supports Suspend to RAM
         (S3). For more information, see section 7.5 “ACPI Suspend Modes and Resume Events”.

         DEEP Sx

         The Deep Sx is a lower power state employed to minimize the power consumption while in S3/S4/S5. In the Deep Sx state, the system entry
         condition determines if the system context is maintained or not. All power is shut off except for minimal logic which supports limited set of
         wake events for Deep Sx. The Deep Sx on resumption, puts system back into the state it is entered from. In other words, if Deep Sx state was
         entered from S3 state, then the resume path will place system back into S3.

         S5e Power State

         The conga-TC570 features a congatec proprietary Enhanced Soft-Off power state. See section 6.2.6 “Enhanced Soft-Off State” for more
         information.

6.2     congatec Board Controller (cBC)
        The conga-TC570 is equipped with Microchip microcontroller. This onboard microcontroller plays an important role for most of the congatec
        embedded/industrial PC features. It fully isolates some of the embedded features such as system monitoring or the I²C bus from the x86 core
        architecture, which results in higher embedded feature performance and more reliability, even when the x86 processor is in a low power mode.
        It also ensures that the congatec embedded feature set is fully compatible amongst all congatec modules.

        The board controller supports the following features:
        • Board information
        • Watchdog
        • Power loss control
        • General Purpose Input/Output (see section 5.1.11 “GPIOs”)
        • I2C bus (see section 5.1.9 “I²C Bus”)
        • SMBus (see section 5.1.10 “SMBus”)
        • UART (see section 5.1.12 “General Purpose Serial Interface”)
        • Fan control
        • Enhanced soft-off state (S5e)


6.2.1   Board Information
        The cBC provides a rich data-set of manufacturing and board information such as serial number, EAN number, hardware and firmware revisions,
        and so on. It also keeps track of dynamically changing data like runtime meter and boot counter.


6.2.2   General Purpose Input/Output
        The conga-TC570 offers general purpose inputs and outputs for custom system design. These GPIOs are controlled by the cBC.


6.2.3   Watchdog
        The conga-TC570 is equipped with a multi stage watchdog solution that is triggered by software. For more information about the Watchdog
        feature, see the application note AN3_Watchdog.pdf on the congatec GmbH website at www.congatec.com.
        Note

        The conga-TC570 module does not support the watchdog NMI mode.
        Copyright © 2021 congatec GmbH 							TCTLm108 							                                                                                 39/76
6.2.4   Power Loss Control
        The cBC provides the power loss control feature. The power loss control feature determines the behaviour of the system after an AC power
        loss occurs. This feature applies to systems with ATX-style power supplies which support standby power rail.

        The term “power loss” implies that all power sources, including the standby power are lost (G3 state). Once power loss (transition to G3) or
        shutdown (transition to S5) occurs, the board controller continuously monitors the standby power rail. If the standby voltage remains stable for
        30 seconds, the cBC assumes the system was switched off properly. If the standby voltage is no longer detected within 30 seconds, the module
        considers this an AC power loss condition.

        The power loss control feature has three different modes that define how the system responds when standby power is restored after a power
        loss occurs. The modes are:
        • Turn On: The system is turned on after a power loss condition
        • Remain Off: The system is kept off after a power loss condition
        • Last State: The board controller restores the last state of the system before the power loss condition
        Note

        1. If a power loss condition occurs within 30 seconds after a regular shutdown, the cBC may incorrectly set the last state to “ON”.

        2. The settings for power loss control have no effect on systems with AT-style power supplies which do not support standby power rail.

        3. The 30 seconds monitoring cycle applies only to the “Last State” power loss control mode.


6.2.5   Fan Control
        The conga-TC570 has additional signals and functions to further improve system management. One of these signals is FAN_PWMOUT, an output
        signal that allows system fan control using a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output. Additionally, there is an input signal called FAN_TACHOIN
        that provides the ability to monitor the system’s fan RPMs (revolutions per minute). This signal must receive two pulses per revolution in order
        to produce an accurate reading. For this reason, a two pulse per revolution fan or similar hardware solution is recommended.

        Note

        1. A four wire fan must be used to generate the correct speed readout.

        2. For the correct fan control (FAN_PWMOUT, FAN_TACHIN) implementation, see the COM Express Design Guide.



        Copyright © 2021 congatec GmbH 							TCTLm108 							                                                                                     40/76
6.2.6   Enhanced Soft-Off State
        The conga-TC570 supports an enhanced Soft-Off state (S5e)—a congatec proprietary low-power Soft-Off state. In this state, the CPU module
        switches off almost all the onboard logic in order to reduce the power consumption to absolute minimum (between 0.05 mA and 0.09 mA).

        The S5e supports power button, sleep button and SMBALERT# wake events. Refer to congatec application note AN36_S5e_Implementation.pdf
        for detailed description of the S5e state.


6.3     OEM BIOS Customization
        The conga-TC570 is equipped with congatec Embedded BIOS, which is based on American Megatrends Inc. Aptio UEFI firmware. The congatec
        Embedded BIOS allows system designers to modify the BIOS. For more information about customizing the congatec Embedded BIOS, refer to
        the congatec System Utility user’s guide CGUTLm1x.pdf on the congatec website at www.congatec.com or contact technical support.

        The customization features supported are described below:


6.3.1   OEM Default Settings
        This feature allows system designers to create and store their own BIOS default configuration. Customized BIOS development by congatec for
        OEM default settings is no longer necessary because customers can easily perform this configuration by themselves using the congatec system
        utility CGUTIL. See congatec application note AN8_Create_OEM_Default_Map.pdf on the congatec website for details on how to add OEM
        default settings to the congatec Embedded BIOS.


6.3.2   OEM Boot Logo
        This feature allows system designers to replace the standard text output displayed during POST with their own BIOS boot logo. Customized
        BIOS development by congatec for OEM Boot Logo is no longer necessary because customers can easily perform this configuration by
        themselves using the congatec system utility CGUTIL. See congatec application note AN8_Create_And_Add_Bootlogo.pdf on the congatec
        website for details on how to add OEM boot logo to the congatec Embedded BIOS.


6.3.3   OEM POST Logo
        This feature allows system designers to replace the congatec POST logo displayed in the upper left corner of the screen during BIOS POST
        with their own BIOS POST logo. Use the congatec system utility CGUTIL 1.5.4 or later to replace/add the OEM POST logo.



        Copyright © 2021 congatec GmbH 							TCTLm108 							                                                                                41/76
6.3.4   OEM DXE Driver
        This feature allows designers to add their own UEFI DXE driver to the congatec embedded BIOS. Contact congatec technical support for more
        information on how to add an OEM DXE driver.


6.4     congatec Battery Management Interface
        To facilitate the development of battery powered mobile systems based on embedded modules, congatec GmbH defined an interface for
        the exchange of data between a CPU module (using an ACPI operating system) and a Smart Battery system. A system developed according
        to the congatec Battery Management Interface Specification can provide the battery management functions supported by an ACPI capable
        operating system (for example, charge state of the battery, information about the battery, alarms/events for certain battery states and so on)
        without the need for additional modifications to the system BIOS.

        In addition to the ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery, the latest versions of the conga-TC570 BIOS and board controller firmware also
        support LTC1760 battery manager from Linear Technology and a battery only solution (no smart battery system manager). All three battery
        solutions are supported on the I2C bus and the SMBus. This gives the system designer more flexibility when choosing the appropriate battery
        sub-system. For more information about the supported Battery Management Interface, contact your local sales representative.

        congatec modules are designed according to the High Power SMBus DC specification to support a maximum bus capacitance of 400 pF. When
        using a low-power end device like the LTC1760, the current drawn from the module’s pull-up resistors must be considered. Therefore, the
        implementation on the carrier board must be adjusted accordingly.


6.5     API Support (CGOS)
        In order to benefit from the above mentioned non-industry standard feature set, congatec provides an API that allows application software
        developers to easily integrate all these features into their code. The CGOS API (congatec Operating System Application Programming
        Interface) is the congatec proprietary API that is available for all commonly used Operating Systems such as Win32, Win64, Win CE, Linux.
        The architecture of the CGOS API driver provides the ability to write application software that runs unmodified on all congatec CPU modules.
        All the hardware related code is contained within the congatec embedded BIOS on the module. See section 1.1 of the CGOS API software
        developers guide, available on the congatec website.


6.6     Security Features
        The conga-TC570 offers a discrete SPI TPM 2.0 (Infineon SLB9670VQ2.0) by default.

6.7   Suspend to Ram
      The Suspend to RAM feature is available on the conga-TC570.

7     conga Tech Notes
      The conga-TC570 has some technological features that require additional explanation. The following section will give the reader a better
      understanding of some of these features.


7.1   Adaptive Thermal Monitor and Catastrophic Thermal Protection
      Intel® Xeon, Core™ i7/i5/i3 and Celeron® and Pentium® processors have a thermal monitor feature that helps to control the processor
      temperature. The integrated TCC (Thermal Control Circuit) activates if the processor silicon reaches its maximum operating temperature. The
      activation temperature that the Intel® Thermal Monitor uses to activate the TCC can be slightly modified via TCC Activation Offset in BIOS
      setup submenu “CPU submenu”.

      The Adaptive Thermal Monitor controls the processor temperature using two methods:
      • Adjusting the processor’s operating frequency and core voltage (EIST transitions)
      • Modulating (start/stop) the processor’s internal clocks at a duty cycle of 25% on and 75% off
      When activated, the TCC causes both processor core and graphics core to reduce frequency and voltage adaptively. The Adaptive Thermal
      Monitor will remain active as long as the package temperature remains at its specified limit. Therefore, the Adaptive Thermal Monitor will
      continue to reduce the package frequency and voltage until the TCC is de-activated. Clock modulation is activated if frequency and voltage
      adjustments are insufficient. Additional hardware, software driver, or operating system support is not required.

      Intel®’s Core™ i7/i5/i3, Celeron® and Pentium® processors use the THERMTRIP# signal to shut down the system if the processor’s silicon
      reaches a temperature of approximately 125°C. The THERMTRIP# signal activation is completely independent from processor activity and
      therefore does not produce any bus cycles.

      Note

      1. For THERMTRIP# to switch off the system automatically, use an ATX style power supply

      2. The maximum operating temperature for Intel® Core™ i7/i5/i3, Celeron® and Pentium® processors is 100°C

      3. To ensure that the TCC is active for only short periods of time, thus reducing the impact on processor performance to a minimum, it is
         necessary to have a properly designed thermal solution. The Intel® Core™ i7/i5/i3, Celeron® and Pentium® processor’s respective datasheet
         can provide you with more information about this subject.

7.2     Processor Performance Control

7.2.1   Intel® SpeedStep® Technology (EIST)
        Intel® processors found on the conga-TC570 run at different voltage/frequency states (performance states), which is referred to as Enhanced
        Intel® SpeedStep® Technology (EIST). Operating systems that support performance control take advantage of microprocessors that use several
        different performance states in order to efficiently operate the processor when it is not being fully used. The operating system will determine
        the necessary performance state that the processor should run at so that the optimal balance between performance and power consumption
        can be achieved during runtime. The Windows family of operating systems links its processor performance control policy to the power scheme
        setting. You must ensure that the power scheme setting you choose has the ability to support Enhanced Intel® SpeedStep® technology.

        The 11th Generation Intel® Core™ processor family supports Intel Speed Shift, a new and energy efficient method for frequency control. This
        feature is also referred to as Hardware-controlled Performance States (HWP). It is a hardware implementation of the ACPI defined Collaborative
        Processor Performance Control (CPPC2) and is supported by newer operating systems (Win 8.1 or newer).

        With this feature enabled, the processor autonomously selects performance states based on workload demand and thermal limits while also
        considering information provided by the OS e.g., the performance limits and workload history.


7.2.2   Intel® Turbo Boost Technology
        Intel® Turbo Boost Technology allows processor cores to run faster than the base operating frequency if it is operating below power, current, and
        temperature specification limits. Intel® Turbo Boost Technology is activated when the Operating System (OS) requests the highest processor
        performance state. The maximum frequency of Intel® Turbo Boost Technology depends on the number of active cores. The amount of time the
        processor spends in the Intel Turbo Boost Technology state depends on the workload and operating environment.

        Any of the following can set the upper limit of Intel® Turbo Boost Technology on a given workload:
        • Number of active cores
        • Estimated current consumption
        • Estimated power consumption
        • Processor temperature
        When the processor is operating below these limits and the user’s workload demands additional performance, the processor frequency
        dynamically increases by 100 MHz on short and regular intervals until the upper limit is met or the maximum possible upside for the number
        of active cores is reached.

      For more information about Intel® Turbo Boost Technology, visit the Intel® website.

      Note

      1. Only conga-TC570 variants that feature the Core™ i7, i5 and i3 processors support Intel® Turbo BoostTechnology. Refer to section 1.2
         “Options Information” for information about the maximum turbo frequency available for conga-TC570 variants.

      2. For real-time sensitive applications, disable EIST and Turbo Mode in the BIOS setup to ensure a more deterministic performance.

      3. Disable Turbo mode for industrial use condition.


7.3   Intel® Virtualization Technology
      Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT) makes a single system appear as multiple independent systems to software. With this technology,
      multiple, independent operating systems can run simultaneously on a single system. The technology components support virtualization of
      platforms based on Intel architecture microprocessors and chipsets. Intel® Virtualization Technology for IA-32, Intel® 64 and Intel® Architecture
      (Intel® VT-x) added hardware support in the processor to improve the virtualization performance and robustness.

      RTS Real-Time Hypervisor supports Intel VT and is verified on all current congatec x86 hardware.

      Note

      congatec supports RTS Hypervisor.


7.4   Thermal Management
      ACPI is responsible for allowing the operating system to play an important part in the system’s thermal management. This results in the
      operating system having the ability to implement cooling decisions according to the demands of the application.

      The conga-TC570 offers hardware-based support for passive and active cooling. Passive cooling is implemented in the Intel CPU via the
      Thermal Control Circuit (TCC ) Activation Offset setting in the CPU configuration setup sub-menu. The TCC in the processor is activated at
      100°C by default but can be lowered by the Activation Offset—for example, an activation offset of “10” will activate TCC at 90°C. ACPI OS
      support is not required. See section 7.1 “Adaptive Thermal Monitor and Catastrophic Thermal Protection” for more information.

      The congatec board controller supports active cooling solution. The board controller controls the fan’s speed based on the temperature
      readings of the CPU. This feature does not require ACPI OS support. The only software-controlled thermal trip point on conga-TC570 is the
      Critical Trip Point.

      The active or passive cooling policy should ensure that the CPU temperature does not reach the critical trip point. However, if the critical trip
      point is reached, the OS will shut down properly in order to prevent damage to the system.

      Use the “critical trip point” setup node in the BIOS setup menu to determine the temperature threshold at which the system shuts down.

      Note

      The Automatic Critical Trip Point BIOS setting shuts down the system at 5°C above the maximum specified temperature of the processor


7.5   ACPI Suspend Modes and Resume Events
      The conga-TC570 BIOS supports S3 (Suspend to RAM), S4 (Suspend to Disk) and S5 (Soft-Off).

8   Signal Descriptions and Pinout Tables
    The following section describes the signals found on COM Express Type 6 connectors used for congatec GmbH modules. The pinout of the
    modules complies with COM Express Type 6, rev. 3.0.

    The table below describes the terminology used in this section. The PU/PD column indicates if a pull-up or pull-down resistor has been used.
    If the field entry area in this column for the signal is empty, then no pull-up or pull-down resistor has been implemented by congatec.

    The “#” symbol at the end of the signal name indicates that the active or asserted state occurs when the signal is at a low voltage level. When
    “#” is not present, the signal is asserted when at a high voltage level.

2.
     The GBE0_LINK# output is not active during a 10 Mb connection. It is only active during a 100 Mb or 1 Gb connection. This is a limitation
     of Ethernet Phy since it only has 3 LED outputs—ACT#, LINK100# and LINK1000#.

     The GBE0_LINK# signal is a logic AND of the GBE0_LINK100# and GBE0_LINK1000# signals on the conga-TC570 module.

      Caution


      1. The signals listed in the table above are used as chipset configuration straps during system reset. In this condition (during reset), they
         are inputs that are pulled to the correct state by either COM Express internally implemented resistors or chipset internally implemented
         resistors that are located on the module.

      2. No external DC loads or external pull-up or pull-down resistors should change the configuration of the signals listed in the above table.
         External resistors may override the internal strap states and cause the COM Express module to malfunction and/or cause irreparable
         damage to the module.

9       System Resources
9.1     I/O Address Assignment
        The I/O address assignment of the conga-TC570 module is functionally identical with a standard PC/AT.
        Note

        The BIOS assigns PCI and PCI Express I/O resources from FFF0h downwards. Non PnP/PCI/PCI Express compliant devices must not consume
        I/O resources in that area.


9.1.1   LPC Bus
        On the conga-TC570 the PCI Express Bus acts as the subtractive decoding agent. All I/O cycles that are not positively decoded are forwarded
        to the PCI Bus not the ESPI or LPC Bus. Only specified I/O ranges are forwarded to the ESPI/LPC Bus. In the congatec Embedded BIOS the
        following I/O address ranges are sent to the ESPI/LPC Bus:
                                                                   2Eh – 2Fh
                                                                   4Eh – 4Fh
                                                                    60h, 64h
                                               8Ch – 8Dh (consumed internally by ESPI to LPC bridge)
                                                                 A00h – A1Fh
                                                       E00h - EFFh (always used internally)
        Parts of these ranges are not available if a Super I/O is used on the carrier board. If a Super I/O is not implemented on the carrier board, then
        these ranges are available for customer use. If you require additional LPC Bus resources other than those mentioned above, or need more
        information about this subject, contact congatec technical support for assistance.

      Note

      1. In the standard configuration, the Intel Management Engine (ME) related devices are partly present or not present at all.

      2. The PCI Express Ports are visible only if a device is attached to the PCI Express Slot on the carrier board.

      3. The Table represents a case when a Single function PCI/PCIe device is connected to all possible slots on the carrier board. The given bus
         numbers will change based on actual hardware configuration.
      Note

      Internal PCI devices not connected to the conga-TC570 are not listed.

10     BIOS Setup Description
       The BIOS setup description of the conga-TC570 can be viewed without having access to the module. However, access to the restricted area of
       the congatec website is required in order to download the necessary tool (CgMlfViewer) and Menu Layout File (MLF).

       The MLF contains the BIOS setup description of a particular BIOS revision. The MLF can be viewed with the CgMlfViewer tool. This tool offers
       a search function to quickly check for supported BIOS features. It also shows where each feature can be found in the BIOS setup menu.

       For more information, read the application note “AN42 - BIOS Setup Description” available at www.congatec.com.

       Note

       If you do not have access to the restricted area of the congatec website, contact your local congatec sales representative.


10.1   Navigating the BIOS Setup Menu
       The BIOS setup menu shows the features and options supported in the congatec BIOS. To access and navigate the BIOS setup menu, press the
       <DEL> or <F2> key during POST. The right frame displays the key legend. Above the key legend is an area reserved for text messages. These
       text messages explain the options and the possible impacts when changing the selected option in the left frame.


10.2   BIOS Versions
       The BIOS displays the BIOS project name and the revision code during POST, and on the main setup screen. The initial production BIOS for
       conga-TC570 is identified as BVTLR1xx or BUTLR1xx, where:
       • R is the identifier for a BIOS ROM file,
       • 1 is the so called feature number and
       • xx is the major and minor revision number.
       The binary size for BVTL and BUTL is 32 MB.

10.3     Updating the BIOS
         BIOS updates are recommeded to correct platform issues or enhance the feature set of the module. The conga-TC570 features a congatec/AMI
         AptioEFI firmware on an onboard flash ROM chip. You can update the firmware with the congatec System Utility. The utility has five versions—
         UEFI shell, DOS based command line1, Win32 command line, Win32 GUI, and Linux version.

         For more information about “Updating the BIOS” refer to the user’s guide for the congatec System Utility “CGUTLm1x.pdf” on the congatec
         website at www.congatec.com.

         Note
         1.
              Deprecated

         Caution

         The DOS command line tool is not officially supported by congatec and therefore not recommended for critical tasks such as firmware
         updates. We recommend to use only the UEFI shell for critical updates.


10.3.1   Update from External Flash
         For instructions on how to update the BIOS from external flash, refer to the AN7_External_BIOS_Update.pdf application note on the congatec
         website at http://www.congatec.com.


10.4     Supported Flash Devices
         The conga-TC570 supports:
         • Macronix MX25L25645G         (32 MB)
         This flash device can be used on the carrier board to support external BIOS. For more information about external BIOS support, refer to the
         Application Note “AN7_External_BIOS_Update.pdf” on the congatec website at http://www.congatec.com.
