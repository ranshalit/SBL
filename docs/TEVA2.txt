1     Introduction
1.1   COM Express™ Concept
      COM Express™ is an open industry standard defined specifically for COMs (computer on modules). Its creation makes it possible to smoothly
      transition from legacy interfaces to the newest technologies available today.

      A Computer On Module integrates all the core components and standard I/O interfaces of a common PC onto an application specific carrier
      board. The key advantage of the COM in the embedded computer industries is that all the highly integrated, high speed components such as
      CPU, chipsets and memory are combined on a small module form factor for easy adaptation into different applications across multiple market
      segments.

      COM Express™ modules have standardized form factors and specified pinouts on the two system connectors that remain the same regardless
      of the vendor. The COM Express™ module reflects the functional requirements for a wide range of embedded applications. These functions
      include, but are not limited to, PCI Express, PCI, Graphics, High Definition Audio, parallel ATA, serial ATA, Gigabit Ethernet and USB ports.
      Two ruggedized, shielded connectors provide the carrier board interface and carry all the I/O signals to and from the COM Express™ module.

      Carrier board designers can use as little or as many of the I/O interfaces as deemed necessary. The carrier board can therefore provide all
      the interface connectors required to attach the system to the application specific peripherals. This versatility allows the designer to create a
      dense and optimized package, which results in a more reliable product while simplifying system integration. Most importantly, COM Express™
      modules are scalable, which means once an application has been created there is the ability to diversify the product range through the use
      of different performance class or form factor size modules. Simply unplug one module and replace it with another; no redesign is necessary.


1.2   conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0
      The conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 carrier board is designed based on the Type 6 pinout definition and it complies with COM Express Specification
      3.0. The conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 provides most of the functional requirements for any embedded PC application. These functions include, but
      are not limited to a rich complement of contemporary high bandwidth serial interfaces such as PCI Express, Serial ATA, USB 2.0, and Gigabit
      Ethernet. To ensure stable data throughput, the carrier board is equipped with two high performance connectors in accordance with the COM
      Express specification.

      By combining the scalability of COM Express modules, the conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 carrier board provides manufacturers and developers
      with a platform to jump-start the development of systems and applications based on COM Express specification. This helps to reduce product
      design cycle and encourages rapid innovation in system design, to meet the ever-changing needs of the market.

      The various features and capabilities offered by the conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 makes it ideal for the integration of Compact and Basic form
      factor CPU modules.

4.3   Power Supply Connector
      The conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 provides the following connectors for power supply:
      • standard 24-pin ATX connector (X63)
      • 12 V DC banana jack (X41 and X42)
      Note

      1. In ATX mode, the +3.3 V, +5 V and +12 V are derived from the ATX power supply. If you supply 12 V DC power via the DC banana jack,
         the onboard DC/DC regulators will generate the 3.3 V, 5 V and 12 V.

      2. Do not supply power to both the DC banana jack and the ATX connector at the same time.

        module starts after you press the power-on button SW16 (ATX mode). To configure the power supply to operate in AT mode, set DIP SW21.1
        to ON. In this mode, the module starts after the power switch on the power supply is turned on.

        Use jumper JP11 to disconnect the 5 V standby voltage from the whole system.

4.3.2   DC Banana Jack
        The conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 provides banana jacks X41 and X42 for DC power supply. This power supply supplies power to both the module
        and the voltage regulators on the carrier board. Although the carrier board is designed for input voltage range of 6 -21 V, the input voltage
        range is defined by the module (usually 12 V).

        Caution
                                                                                                                                      X41          X42

4.3.5   Power-Up Control
        The module’s SUS_S3# signal controls the ATX power supply control signal (PS_ON#). When the system goes to Suspend to RAM (S3) or
        Soft Off (S5), the module’s chipset asserts the ‘SUS_S3#’ signal. Through the use of an inverter, the low active ‘PS_ON#’ signal goes high and
        switches off the ATX power supply.

        When the system is in a power-down system state, any system wake-up event invokes the chipset of the module to deassert the ‘SUS_S3#’
        signal. With the deassertion, the system transitions to Full-On state (S0).

       Note

       1. These interfaces will not function if the COM Express module does not support them.

       2. DIP SW10.2 controls the eSPI_ENA# signal which the conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 uses to set the operating mode of the LPC/eSPI bus.

       3. The eSPI mode is currently not supported by default.

       Caution


       Do not set DIP SW10.2 to ON if your module does not support eSPI mode.

5       Additional Features
5.1     Buttons
        The conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 features the power, reset, LID and sleep buttons.


5.1.1   Power
        When you press the power button SW16, it triggers the module’s PWRBTN# signal. The triggered event usually initiates a transition from one
        power state to another (for example, from S5 to S0). However, the system’s behavior depends on the ACPI settings of the Operating System.
                                                                               SW16




5.1.2   Reset
        When you press the reset button SW16, it triggers the module’s SYS_RESET# signal. The triggered event usually invokes a system warm reset.
        This behavior however depends on the configuration of the module.
                                                                              SW17




5.1.3   LID
        When you press the lid button SW18, it triggers the module’s LID# signal. The system’s behavior depends on the ACPI settings of the Operating
        System.


                                                                               SW18

5.1.4   Sleep
        When you press the sleep button SW19, it triggers the module’s SLEEP# signal. The system’s behavior depends on the ACPI settings of the
        Operating System.
                                                                   SW19




5.2     Beeper
        The beeper M25 provides audible error code (beep code) information during POST. The beeper is connected to pin B32 (SPKR signal) on the
        COM Express™ module.

        Use DIP SW9.1 to enable or disable the beeper.

        ON               Enable beeper (default)
        OFF              Disable beeper



5.3     Ground Test Points
        The conga-TEVAL/COMe 3.0 provides 4 test points (M1-M4). These test points are connected to ground and they make it easier to connect
        oscilloscope probes or multimeter lines or both to ground during measurements.


                                                                     M1-M4
